## How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. The best way to contribute is by **participating in the community** and **helping other users**. 

You can also contribute by submitting **bug reports** and **feature requests** or writing code (submitting PRs) which can be incorporated into Jesse itself.

In that case, here's what you need to know:

- Before starting to work on a PR, please **reach out** to make sure it **aligns** with the **project's roadmap** and **vision**.
- If your PR makes changes to the source code, please make sure to **add unit tests**. If you're not sure how to do that, just check out some of the already existing [tests](https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse/tree/master/tests).

First, you need to install Jesse from the repository instead of PyPi:

```sh
# first, make sure that the PyPi version is not installed
pip uninstall jesse

# now install Jesse from the repository
git clone https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse.git
cd jesse
pip install -e .
```

Now every change you make to the code will be affected immediately.

After every change, **make sure** your changes did not **break** any functionality by **running tests**:
```
pytest
```
